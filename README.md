# Supermarket Management System

Welcome to the Supermarket Management System repository! 

This is the final project developed for the Databases subject during the Summer Semester of 2023 at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. It was a collaborative effort, with the frontend developed by myself and a groupmate, while the backend was created by another member of our team.

This project is a React-based web application designed for managing supermarket operations. The system allows users to log in as either an admin or a worker. Workers can create checks, while admins have additional privileges such as adding, editing, and deleting products and workers, as well as accessing other information.

## Personal Experience

For me, this project also marks my first experience with React. It provided an excellent opportunity to delve into React development and gain practical experience in building frontend applications using this popular JavaScript library.

## Features

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Users can log in as either an admin or a worker, with different permissions and capabilities based on their role.
- **Check Creation**: Workers can create checks, adding products to customer purchases and calculating totals.
- **Product Management**: Admins can add, edit, and delete products, ensuring an up-to-date inventory.
- **Worker Management**: Admins can manage workers, adding new employees, updating information, or removing them from the system.
- **Access to Information**: Admins have access to additional information such as sales reports, inventory levels, and other relevant data.
